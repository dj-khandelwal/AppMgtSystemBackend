### AppMgtSystemBackend

This is just me experimenting with a little bit of Express/Node/Mongo to build a backend + DB for a basic Job Application Management system I am building for myself to help me keep track of my job applications whilst allowing me to learn some Full Stack Technologies.

The backend just exposes multiple REST APIs for basic Create/Read/Update/Delete operations on job applications as a resource. We can search for submitted applications based on various parameters with results being paginated, update status of individual applications as we go along the hiring season, and this supports the following workflow stages from a Software Engineer Point of view: [Open -> Coding Challenge -> Phone Screen -> On-Site -> Offer].  

Coming soon: Workflow stages supporting multiple stages like (Data challenge/design challenge/product discussions/etc.) based on user job profile.
Front End: A React front end is in-progress!
