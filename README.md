### AppMgtSystemBackend

This is just me experimenting with a little bit of Express/Node/Mongo to build a backend + DB for a basic Job Application Management system I am building for myself to help me keep track of my job applications whilst allowing me to learn some Full Stack Technologies.

Front End: Working on it with React and will be coming soon!
